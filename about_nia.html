     Hi! My name is Nia Davis a junior studying Communications and Information Science. Some of my interestes include dance, design, and writing. I took this class out of curiosity to learn more about how demographics are affected in the world of technology, and how code can allow people to have power. I am also an information science major so taking this was part of my requisits. If I were to pick something as my favorite tech thing, I would probably pick my MacBook. I love that I can use my airpods easily, that I can copy straight from my phone and even mirror my phone on my computer, and just the overall user experience. 

      Check out some of our tech heros and more resources in the other tabs!
