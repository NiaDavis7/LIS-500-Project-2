     Hi! My name is Nia Davis a junior studying Communications and Information Science. Some of my interestes include dance, design, and writing. I took this class out of curiosity to learn more about how demographics are affected in the world of technology, and how code can allow people to have power. I am also an information science major so taking this was part of my requisits. If I were to pick something as my favorite tech thing, I would probably pick my MacBook. I love that I can use my airpods easily, that I can copy straight from my phone and even mirror my phone on my computer, and just the overall user experience.
