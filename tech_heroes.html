    When deciding our tech heroes, we wanted to ensure that we were picking individuals with multiple identities that caused them to face challenges not only in the tech industry, but in life as a whole. That is why we chose Angelica Ross and Diego Mariscal, as our barrier-breaking, stigma-countering tech heroes.

  <h2>Angelica Ross</h2>
    <p class="ARBioPt1">
  Through adversity, comes a triumphant story. Angelica Ross was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin on November 28, 1980. Ross knew from a young age that she presented herself as feminine. While trying to live in her truth, her mother, an evangelical Christian, often showed her disapproval of Ross’s perception of her identity. After attending college and the U.S. Navy briefly, Ross connected with a drag queen named Traci Ross who helped her transition, thus getting her new last name in her honor. Ross’s transition ultimately left her relationship with her mother estranged, forcing her to support herself through working at Applebee’s, as an escort, and eventually beginning her tech career as a web manager. In 2005, Angelica Ross began her acting career. As a result, Ross featured in multiple critically acclaimed roles in shows such as "Pose" and "American Horror Story".
