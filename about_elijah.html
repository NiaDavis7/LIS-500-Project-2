     Elijah “Eli” Warren is a rising senior at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, interested in the incredibly paramount intersectionality of international and environmental studies. While vigorously pursuing his studies, Elijah was privileged to become an advocate for his neighborhood and city, Chicago, since he was in 7th grade. His first exposure to being a public servant was joining a youth activist program called BRAVE Youth Leaders at the Ark of St. Sabina. From there, he was afforded to participate in numerous organizations and programs, thus receiving a personal congratulations from the Mayor of Chicago, Lori Lightfoot and praises from Former President Barack Obama. At the end of June 2024, Elijah completed an internship with UNICEF USA where he served as member of the National Youth Council that led him to becoming certified in training youth in advocacy and taking part in a pilot dual mentorship program with UNICEF USA CEO Michael J. Nyenhuis. Afterwards, Elijah served as a Community Engagement Project Manager in the City of Chicago’s Department of Public Health (CDPH) where he focused on bridging the gap between local businesses and grassroot organizations on the Southside of Chicago and city funding and departments. Currently, Elijah has returned back to BRAVE Youth Leaders as their Youth Community Engagement Coordinator as he helps develop social justice curriculum and leads all marketing and communications for the organization. In addition, Elijah continues to serve as a Youth Advocate Champion Trainer at UNICEF USA and the Outreach Coordinator at The Trespass Project, a youth-led organization that seeks to increase legal literacy for youth across the world.  Elijah remains an essential part of his community not only through his role, he also continuously pours into volunteer and mentorship experiences. He is driven to become a vital asset to any team that aligns with his values as he strives to embody a model, global citizen.
