  <h2>Implicit Bias</h2>
    <p class="ourDefinition">
      Definition: Implicit Biases are the unconcious attitudes and steryotypes we have that influence our actions and decisions without our awareness. These biases are rooted in a lifetime of experience, culture, media exposure, etc. Oftentimes they can make people act contrary to their stated beliefs, as these biases are often not recognized by the person holding them. These biases can influence our behaviors in many spheres of life, and impact our relationships

      There are several ways people can test their implicit biases. One of these ways is through the Implict Bias Test given by Harvard where you can test several implicit biases you may have through a series of questions and computer actions. It's important to form you own opinion on the test, so I encourage you to go take it. If I were to give my personal opinion on the test, however, I'd say that I don't entirly trust it. For one, I felt like a lot of what I was trying to do was memorize the keys in order to go as fast as I could, and wasn't thinking hard on the actual actions. I also felt that during the question portion of the test, a lot of the questions are solely based on one criteria, in this case race, but in my opinion I don't just think one certain charactersitc could make your actions pertain to the questions they were asking. For example, one of this questions was if I thought black teenagers respected themselves and in my opinion,  as a whole a lot of teenagers don't, it isn’t just limited to race. In that case, it's also age, where they live, and other charactersitcs. I think in that sense it's why it's important to understand intersectionality, because a lot of who we are is made up of several pieces of us, and can influence us. Still, however, I again incourage you to take the test yourself and see how you feel towards it. <br>

  <h2>Intersectionality</h2>
   <p class="ourDefinition">
     Intersectionality is a term that helps describe the multiple layers of identities that an individual has that determine the level of privilege and discrimination that one will experience in society. Certain identities bestow advantages and hindrances that make it easier or more difficult to maintain stability in an ever-changing world.

 <p class="thoughtDef">
     With our polarizing society, concepts like intersectionality are oftentimes met with skepticism stemming from anti-intellectualism, a term that describes a lack of trust in intellectuals, including journalists, scientists, professors, and others who use critical thinking, making informed guesses through reasoning, and research to inform our world about certain situations and concepts not easily explained. I think it is incredibly important that students are consistently encouraged to think critically not only about subjects like math and science, but also about their identities and how they shape some of the experiences they will have in the world. By being able to sit and think about these matters, students are able to, furthermore, appreciate activists and organizations that work to promote DEI efforts, eliminate negative implicit bias, and help people understand how intersectionality can impact experiences of people with varying identities. Ways in which these identities cna be identified and their intersections anaylized is through mapping out identity wheels.
